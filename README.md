Download-NAA-Gov was cobbled together from the [fold3 scraper project](https://github.com/xtraeme-xt/footnotereap) (a significantly more complex and more intelligent tool). Eventually I'd like to roll all of the scrapers together into a single interface.

To use navigate to naa.gov and find a document with a digital attachment. The url will contain:

    http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp 

On this page hit F9 over the 'next page' button (it looks like an arrow ... -->) . Then either hit F10 or click Command->start to download
